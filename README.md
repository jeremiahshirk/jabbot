# Jabbot

## Description

Jabbot is a Ruby micro-framework for creating Jabber/MUC bots,
heavily inspired by Sinatra and Twibot.

I modified the code of Twibot to fit my needs.
The original Twibot code is located at:
http://github.com/cjohansen/twibot/tree/master

A big thank you to Christian Johansen, who wrote the code for Twibot.
Jabbot is heavily based on his code.

If your curious if this code is stable enough:
I have a bot instance running on my server for quite some time now
and it works great :)

## Usage

### Simple example

    # Receive messages, and post them publicly
    message do |message, params|
      post message.text
    end

    # Respond to query if they come from the right crowd
    # query "message" => "user" is just some syntax sugar
    # query "message", "user" will work, too
    query :from => [:cjno, :irbno] do |message, params|
      post "#{message.user} I agree" => message.user
    end

    # Log every single line
    # (you can use "message :all" too ;)
    message do |message, params|
      MyApp.log_message(message)
    end

### Running the bot

To run the bot, simply do:

    ruby bot.rb

Jabbot uses the [at\_exit hook](http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Kernel.html#M005932) to start.

### Configuration

_Deprecated: The option to configure by YAML files will be removed in the next stable release._

Jabbot looks for a configuration file in ./config/bot.yml. It should contain
atleast:

    login: jabber_login
    password: jabber_password
    channel: channel_to_join
    server: server_to_connect_to
    nick: mybot

You can also configure with Ruby:

    configure do |conf|
      conf.login = "my_account"
      conf.nick = "mybot"
    end

If you don't specify login and/or password in any of these ways, Jabbot will fail
Nick is automatically set to "jabbot" unless something different is defined
If you want you can set the XMPP Resource:

    configure do |conf|
      conf.resource ="mybot_resource"
    end

Default is "jabbot".

### "Routes"

Like Sinatra, and other web app frameworks, Jabbot supports "routes":
patterns to match incoming messages:

    message "time :country :city" do |message, params|
      time = MyTimeService.lookup(params[:country], params[:city])
      post "Time is #{time} in #{params[:city]}, #{params[:country]}"
    end

You can have several "message" blocks (or "join", "leave", "query" or "subject").
Every matching block will be called.

Jabbot also supports regular expressions as routes:

    message /^time ([^\s]*) ([^\s]*)/ do |message, params|
      # params is an array of matches when using regexp routes
      time = MyTimeService.lookup(params[0], params[1])
      post "Time is #{time} in #{params[:city]}, #{params[:country]}"
    end

If all you need is exact word matching you can say so:

    message :exact => "pattern" do |message, params|
      ...
    end

Internally this pattern is translated to `/\Apattern\Z/`, so you can use regex literals.

## Requirements

xmpp4r. You'll need atleast 0.4.
You can get it via rubygems:

    gem install xmpp4r

or get it from: http://home.gna.org/xmpp4r/

... and eventmachine:

    gem install eventmachine


## Installation

Jabbot is available via gem:

    gem install jabbot

## Is it Ruby 1.9?

All tests passes on Ruby 1.9.
Seems like it works :)

## Samples

There are two examples in the [samples][] directory:

* [jabbot_example.rb][] is a working sample without real functionality.
* [black.rb][] is the code I use for my own bot (without the config of course).

## Contribute

If you'd like to hack on jabbot, start by forking my repo on GitHub:

http://github.com/badboy/jabbot

jabbot needs xmpp4r, so just install it:

    gem install xmpp4r

Then:

1. Clone down your fork
2. Create a thoughtfully named topic branch to contain your change
3. Hack away
4. Add tests and make sure everything still passes by running `rake`
5. If you are adding new functionality, document it in the README
6. Do not change the version number, I will do that on my end
7. If necessary, rebase your commits into logical chunks, without errors
8. Push the branch up to GitHub
9. Send me (badboy) a pull request for your branch
